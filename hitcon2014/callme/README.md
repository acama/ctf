HITCON CTF 2014 callme Challenge
============================

This is the code for the exploit I wrote for the HITCON 2014 callme challenge. A writeup of this challenge can be found [here](http://acez.re/ctf-writeup-hitcon-ctf-2014-callme-rsbo-ty-sh41lcode/)
First build the shellcode with:
```
make
```
Then run the exploit with:
```
./x.py
```
