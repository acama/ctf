Boston Key Party CTF 2016 qwn2own 
=================================

Exploit for my 'qwn2own' challenge that I wrote for bkpctf 2016.
This exploit should probably work on any OS that can run the browser.
I have tried it on Archlinux and Ubuntu 15.10.
Note that because of the gadget searching step, the exploit runs a little
slow, the browser might look like it is hanging during the search.
Host with the following line and use the qwn2own browser to browse to it:
```
python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```
